# Wrap-with-Tags Extension

The **Wrap-with-Tags** extension allows you to wrap selected text with customizable HTML-like tags using a simple keyboard shortcut. This is ideal for developers and content creators who frequently work with markup or template languages.

## Features

- **Wrap Selected Text with Tags**: Quickly wrap text with opening and closing tags using the default shortcut (`Shift+Alt+P`).

- **Ease of Use**: Seamlessly integrates into your workflow with minimal setup.
  
**Example:**

1. Select some text.
2. Press the shortcut (`Shift+Alt+P`).
3. The text transforms from:

   ```html
   Example Text
   ```

   to:

   ```html
   <Example Text></Example>
   ```
